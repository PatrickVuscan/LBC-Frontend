## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### 1. List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

i) We agreed to attend a majority of Sunday team meetings, or notify at least 1 team member if we'll be absent from team meetings.
- Teammates were invested in this project, found each other an approachable source of help, were strongly communciative, and overall enjoyed each other's company.

ii) We informed each other every time we finish a new feature, made an improvement, or fixed a bug.
- This allowed other members to pull their changes, and anticipate future merge conflicts.
- Other team members could give each other feedback on our commits.
- After every new complete feature, everyone else reflected on their current progress, and suggested more productive work strategies they could try.

iii) We set up a GitHub Actions CI and a small test suite early.
- This prevented us from committing code that fails to compile.
- Streamlined our process of having to run tests manually each time we commit changes.

iv) Though we had separate repositories between the frontend and the backend, we made progress announcements general.
- This allowed the frontend and the backend to keep in touch about each others' progress and plan out how the two parts will connect
- Topics to discuss in all-member meetings were often determined by these general announcements.

v) We shared resources that helped simplify our project.
- This helped other members of the team to become knowledgeable about the technology that each other was using. 
- Reduces development and research time for other members.
- Working with and reviewing each others' code doesn't require having to learn how their imported technologies work.

#### 2. List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.


i) We required bi-weekly meetings with LBC.
- Although we wanted consistent updates and communication with LBC, this commitment needed to be made on both sides of the communication. Unfortunately, LBC was not able to commit to this meeting schedule.

ii) We required our group to submit work regularly.
- Team members occasionally had many assignments and midterms occuring at roughly the same time, so they may not be available to work on the project fully unless they have dedicated a large block of time (e.g. at least 2 hours) and
they didn't have an assignment due soon.

iii) We create a branch rule for master that required the approval of at least 1 team member before anyone can merge to master.
-  While ideally no one should ever commit code that has not been previously peer reviewed, enforcing this pull request rule on GitHub (in Settings > Branches) turned out to be too strict.
- If the majority of teammates are not available, pull requests may take a long time to process, thus slowing down our entire team. In the worst case, two pull requests took about 18 hours to process.
- However, we still encourage our team to submit pull requests before merging to master because it is good practice for a future internship or research position.


#### 3. List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any).
 <!-- * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change. -->

i) We plan on pairing up at least one frontend person with a backend person working on a similar feature, and have
then collabroate closely with one another.
- e.g. If Arun is working on the login page and Henry is working on user authorization and authentification, then
they can stay in close contact with one another to avoid any last-minute frontend-backend integration surprises.

ii) Instead of requiring consistent work submission, meet a deadline
- Since all of us had different assignment and midterm schedules we decided to work on our own terms, but finish the required tasks that each of us were responsible for before an agreed deadline. 

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 <!-- * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed* -->

 - Email Adam that we won't be able to demo our product to LBC before the D2 deadline.
 - LBC sent us articles for our Sanity page, and the LBC logo, and Arun
