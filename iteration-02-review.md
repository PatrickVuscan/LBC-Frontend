## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### 1. List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
 <!-- * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s). -->


i) We agreed to attend a majority of Sunday team meetings, or notify at least 1 team member if we'll be absent from team meetings.
- Teammates were invested in this project, found each other an approachable source of help, were strongly communciative, and overall enjoyed each other's company.

ii) We informed each other every time we finish a new feature, made an improvement, or fixed a bug.
- This allowed other members to pull their changes, and anticipate future merge conflicts.
- Other team members could give each other feedback on our commits.
- After every new complete feature, everyone else reflected on their current progress, and suggested more productive work strategies they could try.

iii) We remember to submit pull requests before merging to the master branch.
- We wanted to practice submitting pull requests for our future internship or research position.
- We had an easily time learning how to submit pull requests, and consistently submit more pull requests.

iv) We set up a GitHub Actions CI and a small test suite early.
- This prevented us from committing code that fails to compile.

v) We created two separate repositories for the frontend and backend. (THIS IS DEBATABLE)
- This kept the frontend and backend loosely coupled.

vi) We shared resources that helped simplify our project.
- We learned 

#### 2. List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
 <!-- * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s). -->


i) We required bi-weekly meetings with LBC.
- Our regular LBC meetings ended when LBC suddenly ghosted us, so we could not update them on our work as frequently.

ii) We required our group to submit work regularly. (THIS IS DEBATABLE).
- Team members occasionally had many assignments and midterms occuring at roughly the same time, so they may not be available to work on the project fully unless they have dedicated a large block of time (e.g. at least 2 hours) and
they didn't have an assignment due soon.

iii) We create a branch rule for master that required the approval of at least 1 team member before anyone can merge to master.
-  While ideally no one should ever commit code that hasn't been previously peer reviewed, enforcing this pull request rule on GitHub (in Settings > Branches) turned out to be too strict.
- If the majority of teammates aren't available, pull requests may take a long time to process, thus slowing down our entire team. In the worst case, two pull requests took about 18 hours to process.


#### 3. List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any).
 <!-- * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change. -->

i) We plan on pairing up at least one frontend person with a backend person working on a similar feature, and have
then collabroate closely with one another.
- e.g. If Arun is working on the login page and Henry is working on user authorization and authentification, then
they can stay in close contact with one another to avoid any last-minute frontend-backend integration surprises.


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 <!-- * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed* -->
