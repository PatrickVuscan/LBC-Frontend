 <!-- > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.

 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution. -->


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### 1. List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
 <!-- * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s). -->


i) We agreed to attend a majority of Sunday team meetings, or notify at least 1 team member if we'll be absent from team meetings.
- Teammates were invested in this project, found each other an approachable source of help, and overall enjoyed each other's company.

ii) We informed each other every time we finish a new feature, made an improvement, or fixed a bug.
- This allowed other members to pull their changes, and anticipate any merge conflicts.
- This also allowed other members to give each other feedback on our commits.
- This made everyone aware of their current progress, and come up with more productive work strategies.

iii) We remember to submit pull requests before merging to the master branch.
- Teammates were interested in learning how to submit pull requests for their future internship.
- Teammates had an easily time learning how to submit pull requests, and continued to submit pull requests.

iv) We set up a GitHub Actions CI and a small test suite early.
- This prevented us from committing code that fails to compile.

v) We created two separated repositories for the frontend and backend. (THIS IS DEBATABLE)
- This kept the frontend and backend loosely coupled.

#### 2. List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
 <!-- * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be unsuccessful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s). -->


i) We required bi-weekly meetings with LBC.
- Meetings could not happen when LBC suddenly ghosted us, since we could not make meaningful progress.

ii) We required our group to submit work regularly. (THIS IS DEBATABLE).
- Team members occasionally had many assignments and midterms occuring at roughly the same time, so they may not be able to work on the project fully unless they have dedicated a large block of time (e.g. at least 2 hours).

iii) We create a branch rule for master that required the approval of at least 1 team member before anyone can merge to master.
-  While ideally no one should commit code to master without a second pair of eyes, enforcing this rule for pull requests turned out to be too strict.
- If the majority of teammates aren't available, pull requests may take a long time to process, thus making our team less agile.


#### 3. List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any).
 <!-- * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change. -->

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 <!-- * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features?
 * Were there change requests?
 * What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed* -->
