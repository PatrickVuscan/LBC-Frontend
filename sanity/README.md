## This folder contains the GROQ queries for Sanity - to retrieve API driven content

Note that GROQ is a query language that is specifically produced and maintained by Sanity.

There is also GraphQL available, however, at the time of creating this, it was not as well designed with GraphQL as GROQ, and so it was not possible to actually use it for our full queries. Sucks lol

After all though, GROQ was basically as good and easy as GraphQL - you can see from the Queries in this folder, that they're simple to write
